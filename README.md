- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sirhenrybasset
Iâ€™m interested in programming, 3D-printing, microprocessors, and so much more you would
not believe it.
Iâ€™m currently developing external graphic routines for my 3D-printers, working on electronics for an ROV
You will not find me in any social media because I abhor them.
A little remark: my username is the name of my beloved dog -long deceased
